## About Zine
Zine is an MIT-licensed project created by [Loris Cro](https://kristoff.it) and
other contributors listed on the [official repository](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine/contributors).

Zine is inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) but features an entirely custom set
of authoring languages:

- [Scripty](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/scripty/) is the small expression
  language that both SuperHTML and SuperMD share to express templating logic.

- [SuperHTML](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/superhtml/) is the HTML templating
   language used by Zine. Unlike most `{{curly braced}}` templating languages,
   SuperHTML uses valid HTML syntax to express the templating logic, adding only
   minor extensions to normal HTML.  
   Thanks to this approach, it offers instant
   syntax checking and autoformatting via [a CLI tool](https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml) as well as Language Server support ([VScode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LorisCro.super)).
  
  ># [NOTE]($block)
  >The correct file extension for SuperHTML templates is `.shtml`.

- [SuperMD](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/supermd/) is a superset of Markdown
  that, instead of relying on inline HTML, offers new constructs for expressing
  content embeds without pulling into your content needless layouting concerns.
  A CLI tool and language server for SuperMD is in the works.
  
  ># [NOTE]($block)
  >The correct file extension for SuperMD pages is `.smd`.

## Zine is alpha software

Zine is not yet complete. The main functionality is present and you will be able
to build even moderately complex static websites without issue.

That said using Zine today does imply participating in the development process
to some degree, which usually means inquiring about the development status of
a feature you need, or reporting a bug.
