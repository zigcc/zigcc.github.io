This page defines the blog section and lists all posts in it.

A "site section" in Zine is a group of pages that form a logical subtree of the
website. It's related to directory structure, but it's not an entirely 1:1 mapping.

What defines a site section in Zine is the presence of `index.smd` files. You
can learn more [in the official Zine docs](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/).

Take also a look at `layouts/blog.shtml` to get an idea of how to render a page
list in a SuperHTML template.

The blog section also has an [RSS feed]($link.alternative('rss')).

In Zine, RSS feeds are considered "alternative" versions of an existing page. In
concrete defines the blog section and that lists all pages in it, is rendered in
two versions: HTML for human readers, and XML for RSS readers.

This is the SuperMD frontmatter code that defines the RSS feed:

```ziggy
.alternatives = [{ 
    .name = "rss",
    .layout = "rss.xml", 
    .output = "index.xml",
}],
```
[(btw syntax highlighting is done statically in Zine, no need for javascript libraries, unless you want to)]($text.attrs('small'))
