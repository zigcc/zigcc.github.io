This second post is mainly here to show you that you can also create single file
posts for convenience. The first post contains more interesting content.

Don't forget to read [the official SuperMD
docs](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/supermd/) to know how to *style* your content.


Btw this sample website also includes the JS/CSS dependencies required to render
math:

```=mathtex
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(\omega) \cdot (-1)^{2 \omega t} \mathrm{d}\omega \\
F(\omega) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) \div (-1)^{2 \omega t} \mathrm{d}t \\
\end{aligned}
```

This: [`(-1)^x = \cos(\pi x) + i\sin(\pi x)`]($mathtex) is an inline equation
instead!
